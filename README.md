## Project Brief
Build the system that Pinterest uses to analyse both historical, and real-time data generated by post from their users.

Pinterest has world-class machine learning engineering systems. They have billioons of user interactions such as image uploads or image clicks which they need to process every day to inform the decisions to make. In this project, I am building a system in the cloud that takes in those events and runs them throught two separate pipelines. One for computing real-time metrics such as profile popularity, which would be used to recommend that profile in real-time. Another is for computing metrics that depend on historical data such as the most popular category this year.
